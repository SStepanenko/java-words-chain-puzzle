## Task formulation

It is required to build words chain from start word to end word using words from given vocabulary (start word can be absent in vocabulary). 
Each word in chain should be different in one character from previous. All words in chain must have equal length. It is desirable to find words chain of shortest length. 
Name "Elephant from Fly" has sense for Russian language because these words have equal length (муха -> слон), for English language it could be for example "Dog from Cat" (dog -> cat).
